# How the Operator Works

To start making changes to the PHEE Operator, it's crucial to understand several key components that define the architecture of the operator and how they interact. You can refer to the official documentation for further clarity, but hereâ€™s a brief explanation:

### Key Components

#### Custom Resource Definition (CRD) and Custom Resource (CR)

- **Custom Resource Definition (CRD):** 
  The CRD is a schema that defines the structure and validation rules for custom resources. It acts as a blueprint specifying how custom resources should be formatted and what fields they should include.

- **Custom Resource (CR):** 
  The CR is an instance of the CRD, representing a specific configuration of resources. Think of the CRD as a template or switchboard and the CR as the plug that fits into this switchboard. The CR must adhere to the schema defined by the CRD to ensure proper functionality. Essentially, the CR defines the desired state of resources that the operator should manage.

#### Controller File

- **Purpose:** 
  The controller file is a Kubernetes component that watches for changes to custom resources and ensures that the cluster's state matches the desired state specified by the CR. It uses the values defined in the CR to create, update, or delete resources as needed.

- **Function:** 
  The controller continuously monitors custom resources and triggers reconciliation processes to align the cluster's actual state with the desired state defined in the CR. If there are any changes in the CR, the controller invokes reconciliation methods to update the cluster accordingly.

#### Kind and Group

- **Kind:** 
  The `kind` defines the type of resource, and it plays a crucial role in linking the CRD, CR, and controller. The CRD defines a kind, which must be used in the CR to establish a connection between the CR and the CRD. The controller uses this kind to identify and manage the custom resource.

- **Group:** 
  The `group` categorizes resource types within different API versions. When the controller interacts with a CR, it checks the group and version specified in the CRD to ensure compatibility and perform appropriate API operations.


# Explanation of Files

## Deployment files

### ph-ee-CustomResourceDefinition.yaml 

Our CRD for the operator contains all the fields that our controller file might need to maintain the desired state of the cluster. It defines the structure and validation rules for the custom resources (CR), ensuring that the custom resources adhere to the specified format and contain all necessary information for the operator to function correctly.

#### Metadata

**Metadata** contains essential information about the CRD, such as its `name`, which identifies the CRD within the Kubernetes API. This `name` is formatted as `<plural>.<group>`, where `plural` is the plural form of the resource name and `group` specifies the API group. The `metadata` section helps Kubernetes identify and manage the CRD.

#### Spec

**Spec** defines the specifications and behavior of the custom resource. This includes:
- **Group**: The API group under which the CRD is categorized.
- **Names**: Specifies the `kind`, `listKind`, `plural`, `singular`, and optional `shortNames` for the custom resource.
- **Scope**: Indicates whether the CRD is `Namespaced` or `Cluster-wide`.
- **Versions**: Defines the versions of the CRD, including whether they are `served` and used for `storage`. It also specifies `subresources` like `status` and the `schema` for validation.

#### Schema (openAPIV3Schema)

**Schema (openAPIV3Schema)** outlines the structure and validation rules for the custom resource's specification. It includes the `spec` and its fields, providing a detailed structure for how the custom resources are defined and validated. This block is crucial for ensuring that the custom resources conform to the specified format.

- **Spec** fields:
  - `enabled`
  - `volMount`
  - `replicas`
  - `image`
  - `containerPort` 
  - `environment` 
  - `resources` 
  - `livenessProbe`
  - `readinessProbe`
  - `ingress`
  - `services`
  - `initContainerEnabled`
  - `rbacEnabled`
  - `secretEnabled`
  - `configMapEnabled`
  - `ingressEnabled`

#### Status

**Status** provides information about the state of the custom resource. It includes fields such as `availableReplicas`, `errorMessage`, `lastAppliedImage`, and `ready`. This section is used to track the current state and health of the resource, making it easier to monitor and manage its lifecycle.

### operator_deployment_manifests.yaml

This YAML file defines several Kubernetes resources essential for deploying and managing the PHEE Importer Operator. It starts with a `ServiceAccount`, which is used by the operator to interact with the Kubernetes API. The `Deployment` specifies how the operator should be deployed, including the Docker image to use, resource requests and limits, environment variables, and the service account to associate with it. The `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` provide the operator with the necessary permissions to access and manage various Kubernetes resources across the cluster. The `Role` and `RoleBinding` are used to grant specific permissions within the `default` namespace, ensuring the operator can manage resources like custom resources, their statuses, and associated roles. Overall, this file configures the operator's runtime environment, access controls, and permissions, ensuring it operates correctly and securely within the Kubernetes cluster. Two very important configurations to notice in this file are, the image name and the apigroups in `ClusterRole`

## SRC Files
